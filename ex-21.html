        <h1>Semant Elements</h1>
        <p>
            How much does semantic HTML improves the foundation of any web page?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML5 is the version of HTML currently used today</li>
            <li>
                A div element and a span element are used to structure
                content,but neither of these give meaning to either the
                programmer or the browser
            </li>
            <li>
                One of the goals of HTML5 is to upgrade the previous structure
                with new semantic elements that provide better benefits:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It can be accessed and engaged with by various users,such as ones who use screen readers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The content in these elements are more discoverable for user through places like search engines. Sucha as Google
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The actual HTML code becomes cleaner and better readability for programmers and easier to maintain
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
